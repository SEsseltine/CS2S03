# Assignment 4

## Problem 1 - Unique Elements
You have learned sorting and searching arrays in class. For this exercise write a program in C to print all unique elements in an array. You can start with initializing an array of any size or get the array as input from user.

## Problem 2 - Upper Triangular
Write a program in C to find the sum of upper triangular elements of a matrix use the example below as a multi-dimensional array.

| | | | | |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| |1|**2**|**4**| |
| |3|4|**6**| |
| |3|8|8| |
| | | | | |

Example: Sum of upper triangular matrix element is: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12

## Problem 3 - Random Permutation
A random permutation is a random ordering of a set of elements or numbers. The use of random permutations is often central to fields that use randomized algorithms. A good example of a random permutation is the shuffling of a deck of cards.  Write a program in C to generate a random permutation of array elements. You can start with initializing an array of any size or get the array as input from user.

## Problem 4 - Arrays and Recursion
You have learned to create recursive functions in a number of problems. Recursion and arrays make an excellent team. Write a program in C to get the largest element of an array using recursion. You can start with initializing an array of any size or get the array as input from user.
